# Thinking Differently About Web Performance
Performance is vital to success on the web, but it is often thought of in terms of load time rather than what happens when a user actually starts using your web app. In this talk, we’ll take an in-depth look into the tools and techniques you can use from right within your browser to help your web app match its native counterparts. We’ll walk through several live demos of real-world performance issues and their solutions, from CPU bottlenecks to page crashing memory leaks. You’ll walk away better understanding the tools at your disposal and how to apply those to up the game of your current or upcoming projects.
